Greetings! I am currently a research assistant in the Center for System Reliability and Safety in the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

I obtained my Bachelor's degree of Engineering, majoring in Industrial Engineering in 2024. Now I am using a gap year to do some research and prepare for applying a doctoral program. 

I am particularly interested in the scientific machine learning!
