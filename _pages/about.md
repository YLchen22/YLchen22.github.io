Greetings! 

I obtained my Bachelor's degree of Engineering, majoring in Industrial Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in July, 2024. 
Now I am using a gap year to do some research, and applying for a doctoral program starting from 2025 Fall. 
I currently work as a research assistant at the Center for System Reliability and Safety of UESTC.

I am particularly interested in the data-centric methods, theory, and scientific application of machine learning. :)

Research Interests
------
I am excited about exploring new mathematical methods and tools for specific, challenging problems. As a growing researcher, I am open (but not limited) to these interconnected topics:
* Data-driven Discovery & Decision
* Statistical Learning
* Interpretable or Physics-informed Machine Learning
* Signal Processing
* System Dynamics and Control
* etc...
