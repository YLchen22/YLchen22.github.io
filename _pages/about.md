Greetings! I am currently a research assistant at the Center for System Reliability and Safety in the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

I obtained my Bachelor's degree of Engineering, majoring in Industrial Engineering in 2024. Now I am using a gap year to do some research and prepare for applying a doctoral program starting from 2025 fall. 

I am particularly interested in the theory and scientific use of machine learning!
