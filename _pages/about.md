Greetings! :) 

I obtained my Bachelor's degree of Engineering, majoring in Industrial Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in July, 2024. 

Currently I am taking a gap year to explore some academic topics and doing research assistant at the Center for System Reliability and Safety of UESTC. I will enter the Master of Data Science program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen (CUHKSZ) from 2025 fall.

Research Interests
------
Doing some math can be fun. I am excited about exploring novel **mathematical methods, tools, and algorithms** to deal with specific and challenging problems (maybe biological or financial).

By the way, as a growing researcher, I am open (but not limited) to these interconnected topics:
* Statistical Learning
* Time Series Analysis
* Data-Driven Modeling or Decision
* Pattern Discovery and Knowledge Extraction
* etc...

Education
------
* B.E. in Industrial Engineering, 2024 <br> University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China
* M.Sc. in Data Science, (Expected) <br> The Chinese University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China
