Greetings! 

I obtained my Bachelor's degree of Engineering, majoring in Industrial Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in July, 2024. 

Currently I am taking a gap year to explore some academic topics and doing research assistant at the Center for System Reliability and Safety of UESTC. I will enter the Master of Data Science program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen from 2025 fall.

I am particularly interested in the statistics and machine learning methods in data science. :)

Research Interests
------
I am excited about exploring new **mathematical methods, tools, and algorithms** for specific, challenging problems.

Also, as a growing researcher, I am open (but not limited) to these interconnected topics:
* Statistical Learning
* Time Series Analysis
* Data-Driven Modeling or Decision
* Pattern Discovery and Knowledge Extraction
* etc...
