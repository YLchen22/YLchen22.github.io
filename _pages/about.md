Greetings! I am currently a research assistant at the Center for System Reliability and Safety in the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

I obtained my Bachelor's degree of Engineering, majoring in Industrial Engineering from UESTC in 2024 summer. Now I am using a gap year to do some research, and applying for doctoral program starting from 2025 fall. 

I am particularly interested in the theory and scientific application of machine learning!
