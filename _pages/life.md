I am an enthusiast of football (soccer), film, literature and history. I used to play for the football team of our school in UESTC.

In my free time, I also enjoy playing video games, especially the products of Paradox Interactive and Nintendo.

I support the National Football Team of China and Arsenal FC. Come On You Gunners!
