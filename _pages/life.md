I am an enthusiast of football (soccer), film, literature and history. I used to play for the football team of our school in UESTC.

In my free time, I also enjoy playing video games, especially the products of **Paradox Interactive and Nintendo**.

My favorite director is **Wes Anderson**. I support **the National Football Team of China** and **Arsenal F.C.** Come On You Gunners!
