I am an enthusiast of football (soccer), film, literature and history. I used to play for the football team of our school in UESTC.

Sometimes I also play video games, for example the products of **Paradox Interactive and Nintendo**.

My favorite film director is **Wes Anderson**. I support **the National Football Team of China** and **Arsenal F.C.** Come On You Gunners!
