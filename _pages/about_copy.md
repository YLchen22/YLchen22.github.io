Greetings! :) 

I obtained my Bachelor's degree of Engineering, majoring in Industrial Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in July, 2024. 

I will enter the Master of Data Science program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen (CUHKSZ) from 2025 fall.

Interests
------
I am still learning the **application of data-driven methods or statistical tools** in specific problems. I believe the prospect of discovering information that can be interpreted and exploited by humans is fascinating and meaningful.

Education
------
* B.E. in Industrial Engineering, 2024 <br> University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China
* M.Sc. in Data Science, (Expected) <br> The Chinese University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China

Experience
------
I was privileged and lucky to explore several research projects with some excellent professors and collaborators, in spite of my shallow knowledge and skills. Thanks to all of my friends!
